### Why Next.js and Strapi?
- Next.js: Chosen for its speed, flexibility, server-side rendering, static site generation, and SEO optimization.
- Strapi: Provides a user-friendly admin dashboard for content management and supports RESTful API queries.

### Design and Development Process
We began the hackathon by creating a design using Figma, inspired by boba, board games, and the calming ambiance of the cafe. Leeanna led the design process, conducting thorough research on the existing website, crafting detailed wireframes, and selecting image assets.

Julian set up Strapi, defining the database structure based on the current website's content. This allowed new content to be added via Strapi's admin dashboard, enabling the Next.js app to fetch and display updated content dynamically. After that, Julian and I worked on implementing the feature of our app!

### Features Implemented
- Event calendar
- Detailed events view
- Games page
- Custom 3D models integrated with Three.js for a personalized touch

### Reflections
This hackathon was an awesome experience! A huge thank you to my team members for their hard work and to Codedex and all organizers and volunteers for making this event possible. Looking forward to more events like this in the future! ðŸ”¥
